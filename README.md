Hi, I'm Aditya. I'm currently a first-year student at the University of Toronto intending to study statistics. 
I have something of an interest in coding, so I am doing my best to get better at that. 
I know Python, and have some experience in HTML/CSS and R.
I'll be looking to post some of my personal projects on this website.
